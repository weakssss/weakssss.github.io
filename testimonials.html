<h4>2017 Reviews</h4>
<p>We had the most amazing wedding day on Friday 23rd June thanks to the amazing staff at Taste Buds and venue staff at Aldwick. Our wedding day was perfect! The venue is stunning, the staff were so helpful and friendly and wanted the day to be perfect for us. The food was absolutely fantastic! We&#8217;ve had quite a few comments on how stunning the venue is and how much our guests have had a brilliant day! Thank you so much for the best day of our lives and I hope to come back one day as a wedding guest and for some wine tasting (the wine is amazing)!<br />
<strong>Stacie &amp; Ashley</strong></p>
<p>We had the best wedding imaginable this Friday at Aldwick Court. From the day we booked it to the day itself, there wasn&#8217;t a thing that the team wouldn&#8217;t do for us. The day was absolutely perfect, the food stunning and the wedding was seamless. I couldn&#8217;t recommend the team enough &#8211; they really are the best! Thank you so much again x<br />
<strong>Megan &amp; Phil</strong></p>
<p>Thank you to the amazing team at Taste Buds &#038; Aldwick. We had an amazing day and it ran without a hitch. Emma, it was like organising the big day with a friend – thank you for making the whole process so painless (and awesome!)<br />
<strong>Alice &amp; Andy</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for everything you and your team did to make our special day perfect. We have had so many glowing reviews of the food we had at our wedding breakfast. People saying it’s the best wedding food they have ever tasted. I agree with them it was amazing. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.<br />
<strong>Matthew &amp; Amy</strong></p>

<strong>Craig Hall</strong></p>
<p>Thank you all so much. The food was delicious and service was impeccable from start to finish. You catered for all our needs and adapted a few meals to suit our needs. All our guests commented on how amazing everything was. You went above and beyond to make our day special and helped with anything needed. A special mention to Laura, You were so much help setting up the day before and helped calm my nerves on the day. I would give more than 5 stars if I could.<br />
<strong>Hayley &amp; Jack</strong></p>
<p>I wish to send my heartfelt thanks to you and your staff, for the lovely buffet you delivered to Hawthorn Court on the day of my Mother&#8217;s funeral. Everyone was highly impressed with the food. We will most certainly recommend you to our friends and relations and will more than likely use you for future events.<br />
<strong>Wendy Pullinger</strong></p>
<p>We had the most amazing wedding day with you on Saturday! The staff were extremely helpful and professional in the lead up to the event and on the day itself. Nothing we asked was too much and Sarah &amp; Emma and their team went out of their way to make sure the day was everything we wanted (and more) with no stress or issues! The food was extremely tasty too and each one of our guests felt individually catered for. We want to thank you all hugely on behalf of all our guests &#8211; as well as ourselves &#8211; as we can truly say it was the best day of our lives so far!<br />
<strong>Jasmine</strong></p>
<p>Your staff were amazing. They helped me through the lead up to the day and the day ran so smoothly. Emma was brilliant. The food was incredible and the venue was truly stunning. Thank you so much for making this the best day of my life! I wish I could do it all again<br />

<h4>2016 Reviews</h4>
<p>We were lucky enough to be guests here for a wedding. The venue is beautiful, it has a relaxed atmosphere, very clean and tidy, Staff were first class they couldn&#8217;t do enough for you. The food was fantastic. 5 star all the way<br />
<strong>Kelly Mitchell</strong></p>
<p>The staff and Taste buds catering were amazing and couldn&#8217;t have been more helpful. Ella and Emma were &#8216;on it&#8217; from start to finish. Everything we asked for and wanted they were able to accommodate and it was all the personal touches that meant the most. The food was 10/10- very generous portions ?? Cannot recommend Aldwick enough. Beautiful venue, great food, great wine, close to Bristol. Perfect!<br />
<strong>Emma Pursall</strong></p>
<p>I was lucky enough to have my wedding at Aldwick in December, the venue is amazing and the staff were brilliant. Emma and Rob made sure our day was perfect and nothing was too much trouble. The food was delicious and we received so many compliments about our special day. I would recommend the venue to any couple looking to get married this year.</p>
<p>We just wanted to say a very big thank you for the 2 Chef Hire evenings you did for us at Henfield Barn. My Mum had a wonderful time and loved the food and really wanted to say thank you to you all<br />
<strong>Sarah Banks</strong></p>
<p>We would like to say a big thank you to you, Annabel and all staff who made our day very special and run so smoothly, we could not have asked for anything more. Everything about the day was jut so perfect and all our guests commented on what a great day it was from start to finish. Yes, of course, I will send you some photos once we have received.<br />
<strong>Julie &amp; Pat Mc Carthy</strong></p>
<p>A big thank you from Paul and I. Our wedding day was just perfect and you played more than a leading part in making that happen for us. The sun even came out!! The food was just excellent and everyone commented on how good it was and how very generous the portions were. I have never been to a wedding where so many photos of food have been posted on Facebook! All the team working with you were lovely and so attentive.<br />
<strong>Gail &amp; paul</strong></p>
<p>Thanks also for coming to my rescue with scissors for my dress. I think I was in double figures for the number of times I was tangled up in it by the end of the day. I hope our paths cross again in the future and I will certainly come to you for catering any future events I am organising at work also.<br />
A huge thank you!<br />
<strong>Gail and Paul</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for making our wedding day so perfect. We are still smiling and buzzing from it. The food was incredible! Thank you to Emma for all your support before &amp; on the day.<br />
<strong>Dave and Claire</strong></p>
<p>If there was a 10 we would choose that! Absolutely first class service from start to finish. Emma and Sandy were amazing. We had the most amazing day and evening. We honestly cannot recommend them enough. The food and wine is amazing and the grounds are gorgeous! If you would like a wedding venue &amp; caterer that really puts you first then I would look no further! #firstclassservice<br />
<strong>Caroline Webber-Gudge</strong></p>
<p>Wow what a day you helped give us. Taste Buds and everyone at Aldwick really made our day so so special. We have had so many comments about the venue, the FOOD (the comments have been lovely) even the drink (lol), just everything. I would love to re do the day again it was just so perfect. We really can&#8217;t thank you enough. Please could you pass this on to everyone and give my thanks<br />
<strong>Emily and Wayne</strong></p>
<p>We just wanted to say a big thank you for all your hard work and effort on our wedding day, the food was great, the service was perfect and the tables looked stunning, we were really impressed. We’re so glad we chose Taste Buds again to make our wedding amazing.<br />
<strong>Emily and Jack</strong></p>
<p>We wanted to thank you all so much for making our wedding day so special. We really enjoyed ourselves and were very happy with all aspects of the day.<br />
<strong>Eleanor and Richard</strong></p>
<p>Thank you to the amazing team at Aldwick and Tastebuds (Sandy, Sarah, Rob and Emma). They made our day perfect from start to finish and were around whenever you needed them but always in the background of the day. The experience was flawless and we can&#8217;t recommend them highly enough &#8211; from beautiful set up (taking into account all the little details) to just taking the stress out of the whole thing and making sure we always had bubbles in our hand! We just had the best day and wish we could re-live it all over again! Thank you Aldwick.<br />
<strong>Gem and Chris Giddings xx</strong></p>
<p>Thank you Taste Buds for catering for a family funeral wake at my chosen venue.I felt from the beginning that you really listened to what I needed, helped me to make good decisions about menu choices and you delivered a beautiful selection of food, well presented and just as promised. Many people commented on the quality of the food which was the main thing, but all your people are lovely to deal with too. Thank you so much, thoroughly recommended.<br />
<strong>Ali Williamson</strong></p>
<p>Aldwick was everything I ever wanted for our special day! The day was absolutely perfect from start to finish and the planning was made so easy! Rob and Emma were so amazing, they really went above and beyond for us, thank you so much! It&#8217;s safe to say we have given a lot of recommendations! Thanks again,<br />
<strong>Ashleigh and Tony</strong></p>
<p>Thank you Rob, Emma, Sandy and everyone else that were apart of making our wedding day so perfect and magical yesterday. We areso overwhelmed at how beautiful the venue, food and surroundings are and how myself and Ben&#8217;s day was just perfect because of all of the hard work of the Aldwick &amp; Taste Buds teams. We truly had the best day of our life and not only us but our family and friends were in awe of how beautiful the venue was and the exceptional service provided. Absolutely faultless. Thank you for making our day so special and one we will treasure forever.<br />
<strong>Rose and Ben Daly</strong></p>
<p>Had my wedding at this beautiful setting on the 22nd July 2016! Don&#8217;t know how to thank Ella, Annabelle and Emma enough. I had the most magical wedding and it would not of been possible without their help and support! All day the ladies were in the background making sure the day was perfect, which it was! Really cannot thank them all enough!<br />
<strong>Laura Cozens</strong></p>
<p>Thank you to all the team at Taste Buds &amp; Aldwick court especially Sarah, Emma and the lovely Beth for making our special day run without a hitch. Fantastic wedding venue we couldn&#8217;t have asked for anything more and were made to feel part of the Aldwick &#8220;family&#8221;. I can&#8217;t thank these guys enough<br />
<strong>Kelly Hill</strong></p>
<p>Aldwick and Taste Buds made my wedding the most perfect day! They couldn&#8217;t do more for us. The food was amazing the venue was perfect. They were the most organised team and kept you informed every step of the way. They couldn&#8217;t do more for you.<br />
<strong>Rebecca Duncan</strong></p>
<p>We had our wedding at Aldwick on the 27th May 2016. I would like to thank the whole team with a special mention to Sandy for making our day so perfect. 100% recommend this venue. Beautiful ground, excellent food and lovely staff. Thank you.<br />

<p>Just a brief note to say a BIG THANK YOU to you and all the team at Taste Buds. The food was fantastic and everyone commented on the quality and the overall service that Laura and her team gave us on the day. Please do pass on our personal thanks to Laura. She really did help make this a special occasion that we will not forget in a long time. When my son comes to getting married we will no doubt be in contact again with the team at Aldwick and Taste Buds. Thank you again.<br />
<strong>Steve and Sue Crew</strong></p>
<p>Just to say a huge thank you to the teams for our wedding on Saturday. It was fantastic and we are forever grateful for the impeccable service, organisation and friendliness towards both Tom and I and our guests. Everyone commented on the fantastic running, decor and food which together made it a perfect day. We really appreciate it so please extend our thank you to all involved.<br />
<strong>Mr and Mrs Vaughan</strong></p>
<p>We thought that the big day was really well organised, which meant we could really enjoy the day without any worry! The venue looked fantastic and the transition between having the ceremony in the old barn, and then moving through into the new barn was seamless! We would both like to thank you for all your efforts, and please pass on our thanks to Taste buds &#8211; the food and service was amazing, we have had lots of fantastic comments from guests!<br />
<strong>Mr and Mrs Nicolaides</strong></p>
<h4>2015 Reviews</h4>
<p>Stu and I wanted to send a very big thank you to you both and your teams for helping us to hold our wonderful wedding day! We honestly did have the best day ever and the venue looked stunning &#8211; so many people complimented us on the venue&#8217;s decor, but also on the venue as a whole. Many guests said how professional the service was during canapés and also for dinner. The also mentioned how excellent the food was, and the pies went down very well! We are absolutely delighted we chose Aldwick for our wedding and it was a pleasure working with you. I felt that we got to know you really well and that made our day even more personal.<br />
<strong>Mr &amp; Mrs Pringle, December 2015</strong></p>
<p>Fantastic food from locally sourced produce. Taste Buds did the catering for our wedding and we really got the feeling that the team care passionately about what they do, and that really came across in the quality of the food. We had so many comments from our guests about the amazing food that was served. A special mention to Emma who was an absolute pleasure to deal with and was brilliant in helping us plan our big day. All round brilliant.<br />
Thank you so much<br />
<strong>Charlotte and Rob Branch</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely stunning food at our wedding at Aldwick Court Farm. We could not have asked for more. All of our guests commented on how amazing the food was throughout the day and how brilliant your staff were. Everything was fantastic and you looked after us so well and were so flexible throughout the planning and event on the day.<br />
I cannot recommend Taste Buds more for your event. They are so lovely and make you feel at ease and will do what ever they can to make your day special and go out of their way. We wanted winter pimms for our wedding but they struggled to get it but they found some and made sure we had the day we wanted. It was just brilliant, Thank you so much<br />
<strong>Charlie and Jamie McGuin</strong></p>
<p>I just wanted to say a MASSIVE thank you for all of your hard work at our wedding on July 4th! You did an amazing job and everybody commented on how helpful and friendly you were. You and your team made our day run really smoothly and worked so hard to make our day so perfect.<br />
Also a big thank you to your team for our delicious food. Many of our guests commented that the food was the best they ever had! Thank you for being so accommodating, especially for some of the tricky dietary requests!<br />
<strong>Gemma &amp; Dan Sparks</strong></p>
<p>Just to say thank you so much for Friday evening. Everyone was very complimentary about your food and the service was fantastic. Thanks also for your help throughout the whole process. I appreciated your expertise as organising an event for 250 clients is not something I do every day! We would have no hesitation recommending you if the chance arises.<br />
<strong>Sara O&#8217;Brien</strong></p>
<p>We wanted to drop you a line to say Thank You for everything you did to make Friday our perfect day. Nothing was too much trouble for you and your team. We&#8217;ve had so many compliments and comments with praise for you, your beautiful venue and the food. Many people telling us it was the best wedding they&#8217;ve been too (for some that included their own!)<br />
<strong>Jessica Le Couteur &amp; Daniel Gilbert</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We had a totally amazing day and so did our friends and family. Everything was just perfect and totally hassle free. The food was some of the best we have ever eaten. The whole setup looked wonderful and everything ran so smoothly and the only hiccups were those of our guests who made good use of the bar facilities! A perfect venue for our perfect wedding. We know as well as anyone, how stressful these days can be, but you guys truly pulled off a magical day for us!&#8221;<br />
<strong>Jo &amp; Rob Huckle</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We just wanted to thank you for doing such a fantastic job last Saturday. Everything ran even more smoothly than we had hoped for thanks to your hard work, excellent organisation and dedication. Our guests were made to feel so welcome and you couldn&#8217;t do enough to help, which meant that we could just relax and enjoy the day knowing that all our guests were in such capable hands. You also did an amazing job of decorating the room and the food was just delicious! We had such a wonderful day in a beautiful setting and we would not hesitate to recommend you to anyone!&#8221;<br />
<strong>Sarah &amp; Ben Lisneuf</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot thank everyone enough for the amazing service, support, attention to detail and general friendliness to both ourselves and our guests. The day was everything we hoped for and it really was the best day of our lives. It was the staff, particularly Sandy, Emma and Rob, who made our day so special, stress free and exactly how we wanted it. I was also incredibly impressed with the standard of the food, it was delicious. One guest said the beef roll in the evening was the best she had ever had! Again all of the staff were so helpful and went above and beyond their &#8216;job&#8217;. I could probably go on forever about how wonderful you all are and how truly personal you made our wedding feel right from viewing it on the open day to the end. We certainly made the right choice!&#8221;<br />
<strong>Lizzie &amp; Will Slater</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Sandy, Emma, Annabel, Rob and all the team. No words can express how amazing you made our wedding day!! The venue looked stunning, the food was fantastic and the whole team were brilliant.

<p>&#8220;Thank you to Sandy and the team at Aldwick Court Farm, we could not have wished for a more perfect venue to hold our big day. We fell in love with the barns at first sight and received much praise from our guests. From start to finish the staff were amazing, special recognition to Emma from the fabulous Taste Buds who provided support and guidance throughout and played a massive part in ensuring our guests were happily fed and watered on the day. We just wish we could do it all again, nobody wanted the party to end. Keep up the good work guys, you do a fantastic job at helping people&#8217;s dreams become reality. We would definitely recommend you to others!!&#8221;<br />

<p>&#8220;Wow, what can we say about Aldwick Court Farm, from the moment we drove in to the venue we knew it was something special&#8230; We could not have asked for a better wedding venue to celebrate our special day with all our friends and family. Emma from TasteBuds was incredible on the day, doing everything and anything we asked. I even changed the table layout the day before and that wasn&#8217;t an issue at all. The food was incredible and everyone commented on how delicious it was&#8230; I would recommend Aldwick Court Farm to everyone who is looking for a unique beautiful setting and something different&#8221;<br />

<p>&#8220;Aldwick Court Farm was the next best thing for our Italian themed wedding bar actually having it in Italy! Even the weather was perfect despite being the end of October! All of our guests commented on what a beautiful venue it was. Taste Buds also did a great job with our bespoke Italian menu; it was delicious and had compliments all round. Thanks to all the staff at Aldwick and Taste Buds for your professional help and advice and for making the day run so smoothly. We couldn&#8217;t have asked for a better wedding. Thanks!&#8221;<br />

<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t have wished for a more perfect wedding venue than Aldwick Court Farm &amp; Vineyard. The Taste Buds team were top notch and we have had several glowing reports from our guests about the food served. Sandy and the rest of the team really do make everything about planning a wedding a lot simpler and they really know their stuff &#8211; I would recommend this venue in a heartbeat!&#8221;<br />
<strong>Charlotte &amp; Richard Campbell</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to thank you so much for playing a large part in making our party a huge success &#8211; the venue looked incredible, the food was amazing and we all were looked after so well by your teams. The feedback on the venue was fantastic &#8211; people were really impressed with the location and the barns. Lots of people have complimented the food and also your lovely staff &#8211; who were so helpful and friendly. We really felt you went out of your way to make everything perfect and achieved it brilliantly. We have had some of the loveliest messages and everyone seemed to be buzzing after they left.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Jane &amp; Ray Kelly</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to say a HUGE HUGE THANK YOU for all you did to make our wedding day the very best day of lives thus far! Everything was as we hoped for and everyone enjoyed every minute. I really wish we could do it all again. The venue looked absolutely beautiful both inside and out and the staff were brilliant. It was pleasure getting to know you and we will most certainly recommend Aldwick Court Farm as a venue to everyone we know looking&#8230; Hopefully one day we will return to Aldwick to relive the happy memories!<br />
<strong>Anna &amp; Paul Peters </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We had such a stunning wedding at Aldwick Court Farm! During the planning, Sandy, Rob, Emma and their teams were so helpful and gave great advice. They were always on hand to help if necessary. On our wedding day, they made us feel so welcome. Many of our guests, both those from Birstol and beyond commented on what an idyllic and breath-taking setting it was. The Taste Buds team produced a delicious BBQ, which was commented on by many of our guests. The whole team worked tirelessly for seamless transitions throughout the day. They helped to give us a day that took us a week for recover from but a lifetime of happy memories. Thank you!&#8221;<br />
<strong>Nadine &amp; Adam Evans</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Huge thanks to Rob, Sandy, Emma and the rest of the team for everything they did to make our wedding day the most perfect day we could ask for! It was absolutely brilliant and we cannot thank you enough for all you did. You thought about every single aspect, went above and beyond for us and were fantastic on the day; taking care of everything making sure it all went smoothly. The venue is an absolutely perfect choice for any couple! A huge thank you to Taste Buds catering, the food was AMAZING (and we really appreciate you catering to all our additional requests)! So many of our guests said that by far, it was the best wedding food that have ever had!! We cannot thank you enough for helping us have the best wedding day that we could have ever dreamed of. It was perfect, we loved every single minute and wouldn&#8217;t change a thing.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Kerrie &amp; Iain Carlin</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;To all at Aldwick Court Farm we say thanks you for the wonderful experience you provided at Samantha &amp; Andy Brindles wedding. Everything was perfect and the venue was exquisite. Many of our friends commented on how beautiful the venue was and it contributed greatly to the wonderful day that we will never forget.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Samantha &amp; Andy Brindle</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you to all the team. Our wedding was just truly amazing and you made the day run so smooth. You were all brill thanks so much&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Just a little note to thank you all for everything you did on the lead up to our big day &amp; on our Wedding Day on the 16th August. We truly had the best day of our lives &amp; without all your help &amp; work the day would not have been the same. All our friends &amp; family commented on how beautiful the room &amp; location was. It&#8217;s such a stunning venue &amp; we will always recommend you&#8221;<br />
<strong>Caroline &amp; Will Tomlinson</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;Just wanted to say a massive thank you for yesterday. We had an absolutely amazing time and couldn&#8217;t have asked for anything more. Loved all the little touches&#8230; all very much appreciated.<br />
A MASSIVE thank you to all the team. We had the most amazing day and it wouldn’t have been possible without you. From the first visit to driving off in our car you were all so welcoming and helpful. We want to do it all again!&#8221; &#8220;The newlyweds have flown off to Tuscany, so from them both and from their families, our heartfelt thanks to you all. Your thoughtful planning and hard work helped to make their wedding day wonderful. Aldwick sparkled in the perfect July sunshine, the wedding breakfast was excellent and the whole day truly memorable.<br />
<strong>Kate &amp; Jon Taylor</strong></p>
<p>We would like to thank you all for all the hard work and effort that went in to Saturday. We had the most perfect day, better than we ever thought. You all made everything so easy and stress free. All our guests could not get over how beautiful Aldwick is, also we have had so many compliments about the food and how wonderful it was (we had a lot of fussy eaters too). I will send you a card when we come back from holidays but I just couldn&#8217;t wait to say a big thank you!<br />
<strong>Holly &amp; Simon</strong></p>
<p>We just wanted to say a massive thank you to yourself and all at Taste Buds for making our wedding so fantastic. The food was delicious and the pies went down so well that our friends are still talking about them! Thank you for being so brilliant and accommodating all our last minute changes and making the venue so beautiful for us. We had the best day ever and you are a very big part of that. We wish you all the best for the future and we are sure you will go from strength to strength.<br />
<strong>Helen &amp; Nick</strong></p>
<p>This is truly a tick all boxes and exceeded expectations review! The place is stunning and spacious, we were so lucky with the weather and it actually felt like we were in France on a vineyard which was just wonderful. Sandy, Rob and the team were helpful from the beginning and made our whole day seamless especially when Sandy had pin an Usher&#8217;s ripped trousers back together&#8230;. Thank you for that!! No stress, immaculately presented and took care of everything from set up to clear down. Emma and the Tastebuds team were exceptional and the food just perfect. Everything felt so personal to Dave and I; it was all just how we wanted it. Informal, fun room to run around safely for kids and a blooming good party. We had our dream wedding and everyone had a blast. We can&#8217;t than you enough. P.s the mystery honeymoon was Mauritius ??<br />
<strong>Steph &amp; Dave</strong></p>
<p>Lloyd and I had such a wonderful day and we cannot thank the team at Aldwick and Taste buds enough for all of their help and support with the run up and on the day. From our point of view everything seemed to run so smoothly, the catering staff were professional and attentive, our glasses were never empty!!We could not have asked for a more perfect day, despite the rain!!! We and everyone else loved every minute!<br />
<strong>Ellie &amp; Lloyd</strong></p>
<p>We wish to thank you and your team for helping to make the Wedding last Saturday into a perfect day. All the guests said how much they enjoyed the fabulous food. We certainly did. I do think that the buffet style approach worked for us and our needs and there was plenty for all. It is a credit to you and your team. The evening supplementary food also went down well. Many said after the Wedding breakfast that they could not eat any more but what was laid on was just too tempting. It was to a very good quality and to a professional standard. So just an appreciation to you and I hope it goes a little way to recommending to others who wish to use your services in the future.<br />
<strong>Simon and Carol Morris</strong></p>
<p>Before we disappear off on honeymoon we just wanted to say a massive thank you for yesterday. We had an absolutely amazing time and we couldn&#8217;t have asked for anything more. Loved all the little touches including the candle in the jelly and singing happy birthday!<br />
<strong>Jon &amp; Kate</strong></p>
<p>I attended my nephews wedding yesterday and felt I had to contact you to say what a wonderful venue Sam &amp; Kelly chose. The food was fantastic and all of your staff were first class. Everything seemed to go so well and it was a really good event. Well done everybody<br />
<strong>Mr Dix</strong></p>
<p>To all you nice people. I am Leigh&#8217;s nan and on Friday spent the day at Aldwick Court Farm &amp; Vineyard. Thank you to everyone who helped make the day so memorable. At my age, you can always find something that annoys you (I didn&#8217;t!). It was a magical day full of happy, hardworking people who were always willing to please. Good food, good service and very professional. I give it a 10/10.<br />
<strong>Kerri &amp; Leigh</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you all so much for such a wonderful day. The organisation was seamless and really allowed us to relax and just enjoy celebrating with our family and friends. All the staff really looked after us and were contentious, nothing was too much trouble. It was perfect! Everyone commented on the fantastic venue and the wonderful food. We couldn&#8217;t fault any of it!&#8221;<br />

<h4>2013 Reviews</h4>
<p>&#8220;Thank you so much for playing such a special part in our wedding day. Right from the very first phone call conversation with Laura, I felt Taste Buds Catering was going to provide a very personal and friendly service. The food itself was absolutely fantastic. We were keen to use local, fresh ingredients and Marco even created a delicious dessert based on our favourite flavours. You really helped to ease the stress of organisation by helping us plan the day, by liaising with our venue directly and being so flexible with our meetings. On our big day the Taste Buds team were extremely professional. So many of our guests have commented both on the friendliness of your staff and the quality of the canapes and the BBQ food (some were especially pleased that there was enough for seconds!) Overall we&#8217;d like to thank you both Laura and Marco for providing such an outstanding service, which we would highly recommend if anyone&#8217;s looking for a catering company who manage to combine the &#8216;personal touch&#8217; with excellent value, a rare find in the world of wedding planning!&#8221;<br />
<strong>Niki &amp; Dave</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Taste Buds provided an excellent service for our big day. We felt that you listened to our requests and tweaked the menu accordingly so we could have the wedding breakfast we wanted within our budget. You provided us with several options to choose from which was great. Nothing was too much trouble and on the day, we hardly noticed you guys were there &#8211; which is the perfect compliment! Oh, and the food was absolutely delicious! Several guests came up to me and commented on it. I knew I could relax because everything was in hand and you helped to make our wedding day very special. Huge thanks.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Lucie &amp; Greg</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I have been meaning to contact you ever since our event in July to thank you for doing such an excellent job for us. Everyone enjoyed the canapes enormously. You were courteous and prompt with all the timings and we were very happy with the service you provided. Many thanks!&#8221;<br />
<strong>Rachael, Bath</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Many thanks for a great buffet on Saturday night, once again your food and customer care has been superb. We look forward to the next occasion when we will be in touch again. We had to give your name and number to several friends who were very impressed.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Katherine</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Just a quick message to thank you again for last night. The food was great &#8211; lots of people have commented on how good it was. This may become an annual event for us, and I will certainly want to book you again and will recommend you if I know of anyone who needs mobile catering.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Rob</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks for all your help in making our day so special. We have had excellent feedback on the food quality, taste, presentation and service. It was excellent so many thanks again.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Paul &amp; Nessa</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Just wanted to say thank you for the wonderful food and service over the weekend. We had a lovely dinner made all the more special by your professionalism.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Lorna</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;A big Thank You for the great service you provided at our Directors Luncheon. The whole event went extremely well and the Directors were all very impressed with the quality of food and standard of service you provided. Thanks for providing such great service and support &#8211; it really does help people like me, too, knowing that I can totally trust someone to do an excellent job!&#8221;<br />
<strong>Elaine</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We chose Taste Buds as caterers for our wedding in October 2010 and what an excellent choice that was &#8211; they were absolutely fantastic. The food was excellent, and it was not an easy menu I can tell you, Marco cooked everything to perfection and we had some incredibly happy guests. Marco spent a long time with us working out exactly what we wanted for our wedding weekend and it really did surpass all our expectations. Everyone raved about the food all weekend. They were so easy to work with and Laura was amazing, she constantly went out of her way to help and find solutions to our problems even if it made their job a lot harder. I cannot recommend Taste Buds highly enough and we were so glad to have chosen them for our special day. Thank you, thank you, thank you.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Pip &amp; Steve</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Many thanks for doing the catering for our wedding, the service was truly first class and the food was delicious (especially the scones and sausages!). We will recommend you to friends and feel free to use us as a reference any time. Thank you once again!&#8221;<br />
<strong>Tim &amp; Liz</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for all your hard work catering and serving for us at our wedding on the 18th September. You all did a marvellous job, were friendly and accommodating. The food was delicious; all our family and friends were very impressed. From our first enquiries with Taste Buds, you have been informative, helpful and pleasant and helped make our wedding day perfect.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Eleanor &amp; James</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The reason we picked Taste Buds was that you could provide a simple menu using good quality ingredients, and you delivered perfectly. Other caterers seemed more keen to promote their own menus at the expense of our wishes, but Taste Buds were able to accommodate our ideas whilst still providing a wealth of much-needed advice and expertise. From the guests, we have heard nothing but positive things about the food and the service.</p>
<p>The other great differentiating factor was the professionalism and enthusiasm that you displayed throughout &#8211; being willing to meet us regularly, at home or the venue &#8211; being in regular contact by email. Everything ran very smoothly from our point of view and dealing with you was a pleasure. Importantly this meant that we could trust you completely with the running of the catering on the day, and we could enjoy ourselves knowing that it was in safe hands.</p>
<p>On the day, all of the staff provided were lovely, and struck the perfect balance between being available when needed, but not too &#8220;in your face&#8221;, and were friendly and understood the tone of the whole event. Everything ran very smoothly &#8211; and you were wonderfully prepared such that you were not unduly affected by the limited facilities of the venue. Certainly if there were any problems, we didn&#8217;t hear about it! Again testament to your conscientiousness and hard work.&#8221;<br />
<strong>James &amp; Tilly</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Taste Buds exceeded all our hopes for our wedding; they were friendly, flexible and accommodating to the needs and requirements of our wedding day, helping us realise what was possible and utilising their past experience to tailor the day for the better. The food and service on the day was superb, allowing us to enjoy a carefree day in which we were able to sit back and enjoy the atmosphere. I would strongly recommend Taste Buds to anyone who wants someone they can trust and feel confident in. Thank you again.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Nathan</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We want to say a massive thank you for providing the catering at our wedding on the 21st. The food was delicious and we had so many compliments about it. But on top of that, the way in which you and your staff handled everything (including the inclement weather and unpredicted relocation of the hogs) with such good humour and outward calm was absolutely fabulous. I would not hesitate to recommend you to others.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Richard &amp; Jane</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We were delighted with the canapés you provided at such short notice for my daughters wedding. There were many comments about the both the quality of appearance and taste. Many thanks again.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Ian</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Just to say a big thank you for the beautiful buffet you delivered to us on Sunday. The food was absolutely lovely and many people asked us who had done the catering &#8211; of course we enlightened them. The food arrived on time and the presentation was brilliant. Taste Buds took away the stress from the day so we could enjoy it as much as everyone else. I will be recommending you to friends and family in the future and who knows we may find the occasion to use you again in the future. Once again, many thanks.&#8221;<br />
<strong>Ann</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We just wanted to thank you and your team for the fantastic catering you provided for our wedding. Marco cooked everything to perfection and we have had so many positive comments from our guests about the food and service provided by Taste Buds. We would certainly recommend you to anyone looking for caterers for a special occasion. Thank you again.&#8221;<br />
